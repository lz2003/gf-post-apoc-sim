# Human Survival Simulation
2020 Simulation Greenfoot Project for ICS4U

By Young Chen, Leo Foo, Lucy Zhao

# Description
This project simulates the survival of a group of humans in a post-apocalyptic world. In this simulation, the humans will gather resources to keep themselves alive from starvation, destruction from a tornado and any zombies that approach. Humans will also create structures in order to increase their chances of survival.

The project also features a moveable camera, as well as the ability to set the number of starting humans.

More details about our simulation can be found in the poster.pdf file.
